# aws-athena-workshop

This workshop is prepared to guide participants on how to use AWS serverless services to build a cloud-native and future-proof serverless data lake architecture. We will use AWS Glue for ETL and data catalog management, Amazon S3 for data lake storage, Amazon Athena to query data and Amazon QuickSight to visualize data.

# Objective
The objective of the workshop is to enable participants to jumpstart their journey of building a serverless data lake using the Lambda Architecture data-processing design pattern. Participants will go through a series of guided hands-on lab exercise using AWS serverless services to build a solution and tackle real-world scenarios.

# Target Audience
This course is intended for Data Architects, Data Engineers, ETL Developers, BI Developers and other data practitioners.

We recommend that attendees of this workshop have working knowledge of database concepts and basic understanding of data storage, processing, and analytics.

Duration
8 hours (includes lecture, demos and hands-on lab activities)

# Lab Environment
An AWS Workshop Studio environment will be provisioned as part of the workshop and can only be accessed for the duration of the event. By using the workshop account for the relevant event, you agree to the AWS Event Terms and Conditions  and the AWS Acceptable Use Policy .

# Getting Started

# Overview
In preparation for the workshop, we have created Amazon S3 buckets, copied sample data files to Amazon S3, and created an IAM service role.

# What is a data lake?
A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analyticsâ€”from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.

# Introducing Amazon S3
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is the largest and most performant object storage service for structured and unstructured data and the storage service of choice to build a data lake. With Amazon S3, you can cost-effectively build and scale a data lake of any size in a secure environment where data is protected by 99.999999999% (11 9s) of durability.

With data lakes built on Amazon S3, you can use native AWS services to run big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to gain insights from your unstructured data sets. Data can be collected from multiple sources and moved into the data lake in its original format. It can be accessed or processed with your choice of purpose-built AWS analytics tools and frameworks. Making it easy and quick to run analytics without the need to move your data to a separate analytics system.
